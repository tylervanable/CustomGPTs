# Overview
[Kynseed Keeper](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-3yF48BOFC-kynseed-keeper) is an AI trained to give users tips, techniques, and walkthroughs of a video game called "Kynseed". 

Kynseed is an RPG indie game developed by PixeCount Studios, which was founded by two video game developers of the popular game "Fable". The art style is reminiscent of 16-bit classics, but meticulously crafted with a modern range of colours and textures that help bring the fairy-tale setting to life.

This game is also a life-sim game, including activities such as foraging, farming, fishing, animal husbandry, relationship building, combat, and store ownership. Extremely British and dripping with folklore, Kynseed is particularly eccentric, whimsical, and humourous in its dialogue, encouraging players to discover the world of humans and Fae.
