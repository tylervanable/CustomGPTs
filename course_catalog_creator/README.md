[Course Catalog Creator](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-gSLQA0T1o-course-catalog-creator)

# Overview

Course Catalog Creator will compile a list of courses similar to the style of a course catalog. Will generate course number, name, description, and pre-requisites. 

Course Catalog Creator requires:
- [1] a discipline (like 'English', 'computer science', or 'neuroscience')
- [2] number of courses (beyond 30 typically is too much for GPT)
- [3] specification of undergraduate or graduate courses
- [4] at least (3) three sub-disciplines or concentrations (for 'English' this may include "Literature", "Rhetoric", and "Creative Writing"...)
